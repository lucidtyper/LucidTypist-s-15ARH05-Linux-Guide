# LucidTypist-s-15ARH05-Linux-Guide
*A unified Setup Guide and tricks used for installing Linux over Lenovo Legion 5 laptop (15ARH05)*

## A little notice
- This repo is being written using several guides over GitHub and other Wikis. References will be added for more information.
- It will mainly be focused on (but could apply to other):
  - Arch based distros (_ArchLinux_, _Endeavour_ and _Manjaro_), _Fedora_ and Ubuntu based distros (_Pop_OS_!).
  - Gnome Desktop Environment ([So I see you're using Gnome](https://youtu.be/FQM5fU7V-MM)).
  - Lenovo Legion 5 laptop, 15ARH05 model, meaning:
    - It uses Ryzen 7 4800H CPU with Radeon Graphics
    - Nvidia Geforce GTX 1650 (TI?/for laptops)
- **Non-free software will be used**, just for the [NVIDIA drivers](https://youtu.be/_36yNWw_07g?t=10)...
- Sections or paragraphs with a üìù memo emoji, means writing is on the way.
- I will try make to get a smile whilst doing all this process.
